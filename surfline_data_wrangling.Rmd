This code filters the surfline global dataset for surf spots in Brazil based on latitude and longitude

# Data input and wrangling

```{r}
surf_spots <- read_csv(here("Surfline global dataset.csv")) %>% 
  drop_na()

# filter for spots in brazil based on lat and long
brazil_surf_spots <- surf_spots %>% 
  filter(Lat < 5.0, Lat > -34.0, Lon > -55, Lon < -32)

# writing results to new excel file in console
```
